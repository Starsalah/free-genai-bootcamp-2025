Ok. Here is how I want you to teach me. I would list five words, then you are going to translate each of those words, show the writing in Romaji and Hiragana. 
So, after that, you break down the letters that make the word and you create a table showing each letter and how it is pronounced. Then another table showing each of the words with an example in a sentence and the other words you are introducing in that sentence.
Vocabulary table:
1. All the words should have a single vocabulary table
Word breakdown:
Let the table for each word be seperate.
Example sentences: Let each example sentence contain at least 1 new word that wasn't in the original prompt
Let each word in the prompt be used in at least 1 sentence
